# liteIE
Internet explorer minified.
You may be about to complain how it has almost no features, ut that's the point. Only a browser box and a URL bar.
# Performance
liteIE ooens about 1.5x faster than IE11 and uses 1/8 the amount of RAM.
# Issues
Browser windows cannot be extended due to the code not being put in to 1.0
